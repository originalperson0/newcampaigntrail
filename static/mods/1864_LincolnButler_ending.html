I hope you are ready and eager to learn about this absolutely fascinating period in American history. For a bit of introduction, my name is Kirby Delauter (he/him), and I prefer you to call me “Dr. Delauter” or “Professor.” I earned a BA at Carleton University in Canada, and completed my MA in American Studies at Benjamin Wade University in Ohio, before moving onto my PhD.<br><br><button onclick='nexte0()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending1' style='display: none;'><p>The course you are enrolled in is a passion of mine. The time period we cover (including the context of the Civil War) is an incredibly important one in both American and world history. We’re going to be looking at the 28-year rule of Benjamin Butler, the last President of the United States and one of history’s most controversial figures. He was a brutal dictator, but used his power to advance liberal causes. He helped destroy many monarchies in Europe, at least for a time, but sponsored the reigns of terror of the Radical ideologues that left the continent torn apart. Butler is a watershed in global history, and the first President of the American Republic. You may have heard in high school about the “Perpetual Republic” era, lasting from 1876 to about ten years after Butler’s death in 1893.<br><br><button onclick='backe0()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte1()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending2' style='display: none;'><div style='overflow-y: scroll;height: 17em;'><table style='margin:0px;padding:0px;display: flex;'><tbody style='display: flex;'><tr><td style='border: none;padding: 0px;display: flow-root;'><p style='margin-left: 0em;margin-right: 0em;'>If you are interested in military history, Marxist theory, colonialism, feminist studies, political science or social justice, I hope this course will thrill you as much as it does me every time I teach it. Before we get into the assignments, you can find below your assigned reading. I kept it short, as this one is a very thorough and authoritative account of the time period. The rest of the readings will be made available for free through the course page as we go through the semester.</p><blockquote><p><i>Foner, Eric. 2011.

His attempts to pursue an aggressive Reconstruction will be carried through with the support of the dominant Republicans, but ultimately the animus against him will end any chance at winning the nomination in 1868, with the party machine deciding for Salmon Chase instead. Reconstruction under Butler will proceed under the watchful guidance of the government, but meet complications arising from the South’s intense hatred of him. The waste and graft of the program, paired with rising white supremacist violence, will see it wind down by the end of the 1870s. In his later years, Butler will attempt numerous runs at high office as a Greenback progressive, winning many votes here and there, but never being seriously considered as a man who could win the broad support of the American people.<br><br><button onclick='backe1i()'>Back</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick='nexte2()'>More</button></p></span><span id='ending3' style='display: none;'><p>In the years to come, scholars will regard Butler’s presidency as a bizarre accident that by all means should never have come to pass. With his innovative and eclectic ideas stymied by a Republican Party content to ignore him and contain his efforts to exercise power, he will leave office thoroughly disillusioned with establishment politics, and the establishment politicians glad to be rid of him. Nonetheless, the devotion he inspired in the hearts of the black population and soldiery, and the working class later on, will strike a chord with many who will come to hold fond memories of him.</p><p>By the twenty-first century, historians will view Butler’s term in a new light: in spite of his poor record as a General and administrator, here was a champion of the downtrodden, beholden to ideals above himself and ahead of his time, whose fervent attempts to bring justice to a nation riddled with injustice spoke to deeply-held convictions that emblemize what it truly means to be an American. Many will postulate about what could have been, had this bulldog of a man been given a freer hand to fight the woes of greed, poverty and injustice.
